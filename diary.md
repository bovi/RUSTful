*Conversation with ChatGPT:*

*General notes:*
ChatGPT can provide accurate API addresses. There are some bugs in the
Rust code it created but when I pointed it to it, it always fixed them.

## Day 2 (2023-03-06)

*Conversation with ChatGPT:*

*General notes:*
ChatGPT mistakenly used the wrong GET and POST parameter. After asking
it was able to fix it. Also today was the first successfull call to list
all users.
