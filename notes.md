# Notes

The following things I notice:

## Syntax detection by ChatGPT is off

Interestingly in conversations like:

```
cargo new ms-graph-api-demo --bin

Change into the project directory:

cd ms-graph-api-demo
```

ChatGPT might format the first code line as SQL and the second as BASH.

## Blaming a tool instead of accepting mistakes

In https://github.com/bovi/RUSTful/blob/main/chat.md?plain=1#L783, ChatGPT made
apparantly a mistake with the devcontainer JSON file but pretends that it is
a temporary issue with Visual Studio Code.
