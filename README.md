# RUSTful

Trying to build a Microsoft Graph API client in Rust.
The special thing: I will only use ChatGPT and Co-Pilot
to build the client. No other documentation will be used.

## Why?

I need to understand how capable ChatGPT and Co-Pilot are.
For this we shouldn't feed the AI with company internal stuff,
so let's use the Microsoft Graph API. I nevertheless wouldn't
want to read the Microsoft documentation.
